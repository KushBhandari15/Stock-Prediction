## Testing

### Automated Testing

We have included some automated test cases to verify the functionality of the `test_stock_prediction` function in the `unit_test.py` file. These test cases cover various scenarios, including selecting invalid stocks, selecting valid stocks with different forecast durations, case-sensitive inputs, and empty inputs.

To run the automated tests, you can execute the `unit_test.py` file using the following command:

```bash
python unit_test.py
```

### Custom Testing
If needed, you can also create your own test cases by modifying the input parameters in the unit_test.py file and running the tests again. Ensure to provide valid input parameters for the stock ticker, start date, and forecast duration to test different scenarios.
The test results will indicate whether each test case passed or failed.
